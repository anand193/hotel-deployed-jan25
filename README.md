🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
📌 Project Overview

With the increasing popularity of online booking platforms, hotel reservations have become more convenient. However, flexible cancellation policies have led to a rise in last-minute cancellations, which negatively impact hotel revenue and operations.

This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset to understand factors that influence cancellations and builds a machine learning model to predict cancellations. By doing so, hotels can take proactive measures such as targeted communication, optimized overbooking strategies, and better resource planning.

🎯 Business Problem

Cancellations cause multiple challenges for hotels:

📉 Revenue loss due to unsold rooms.

💸 Higher costs for re-selling through third-party platforms.

🔻 Reduced profit margins from last-minute price cuts.

⚖️ Operational inefficiencies in staff and resource management.

Goal: Build a predictive model that helps hotels identify high-risk cancellation bookings and take preventive action.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains hotel booking information, including:

Customer demographics (country, market segment, etc.)

Booking details (lead time, room type, number of nights, etc.)

Cancellation status (target variable)

📌 Source: Kaggle / Hotel Booking Demand Dataset

🔍 Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed booking patterns, cancellation rates, and seasonality.

Identified correlations between features and cancellations.

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values & outliers.

Encoded categorical variables.

Performed feature scaling where needed.

Modeling:

Built multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC.

Insights:

Longer lead times and bookings through online travel agents had higher cancellation probability.

Repeat guests had lower cancellation tendency.

🏆 Results

Best Model: Logistic Regression (chosen for interpretability & business context).

Achieved ~83% accuracy and strong recall for cancellation class.

Generated actionable insights for hotel management to reduce cancellations.
